You can store ingredients according to categories (main: body organs, major nutritional components, disease)

### üí° How did NutriProfile start the journey?

Grapefruit used to be one of my favorite fruits. However, I recently heard from my doctor that grapefruit is not 
suitable for my constitution and can worsen my health!! For me, who have avoided foods only known to be unhealthy, 
this made me feel the need to study more about myself and find optimized ingredients. So, I created this program 
to organize and classify them.
